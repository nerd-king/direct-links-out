# ![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nerd-king/direct-links-out/master/icon.png) Direct links out
Userscript that removes all this "You are leaving our site" and other redirection stuff from links.

## Credit

Original script is located [here](https://github.com/nokeya/direct-links-out). 

## Changes

I simply added more domains to the original list, and cleaned up the userscript to comply with linting.

## What Does It Provide

- Better anonymity
- Faster surfing
- Pure JavaScript

## Installation

__Install (Github raw):__ https://github.com/nerd-king/direct-links-out/raw/master/direct-links-out.user.js
